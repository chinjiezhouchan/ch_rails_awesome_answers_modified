# this file is used by a gem called `Bundler` to manage gem dependncies in Rails
# applications. Bundler calculate the proper versions needed based on all the gems
# and then it `locks` Gems to particular version using another files called

# by default Bundler will look for the latest installed Gem version and if it matches 
# the criteria here, it will just use it and and update
# Gemfile.lock accordingly, if the gem is not found, then it will download it from
# rubygems.org.
# by default all the gems in this Gemfile will be `required` when you run your Rails
# application (such as doing `rails s` or `rails c`)
# after adding a new entry here you should run `bundle` which will install the Gem
# if you want to force update a particular gem, you will have to run: 
# `bundle update cowsay`
# generally speaking, you don't need to restart Rails when making changes, one of the
# exception to this rule, is making changes to the `Gemfile`
