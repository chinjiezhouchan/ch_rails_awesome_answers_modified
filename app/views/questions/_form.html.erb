<%#
  Use `form_for` to generate form for an instance of a model.
  From the given instance, it will figure out if the form
  is for a new instance or edit an existing one. It will also
  determine the names that should be used from the instance's
  class.
  
  It will add an hidden input holding an authenticity_token
  identifying the form as being from this Rails application.
  This is a security measure to prevent other computers and servers
  from making POST, DELETE, PATCH and PUT requests to our server.
