    # The third argument is an optional hash of conditions to further filter the

    # For example, here the user can only update published articles.

    # Use the `alias_action` method to assign multiple action names to
    # the same action. This means that the aliased can be used in place
    # for any of the supplied actions.
    # In this case, :crud can be used in place of :create, :read, :update
    # or :delete.
    alias_action(:create, :read, :update, :delete, to: :crud)

    # The first argument to `can` is the action you are giving the user
    # permission to do.

    # The second argument is the resource the user can perform the action on.
    # If you pass :all it will apply to every resource. Otherwise pass a Ruby
    # class of the resource. Usually, we pass the class of a model.

    # (Optional) A block argument is used to determine whether or not a user
    # can perform said action on the resource. If the block returns `true`,
    # the user can the perform action. Otherwise, they can't.
