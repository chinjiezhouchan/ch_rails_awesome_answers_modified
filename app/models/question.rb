# this is the Question model class
# Rails uses meta programming to add attr_accessor to all associated table's columns
# in this those will be: id, title, body, view_count, created_at, updated_at
class Question < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :answers

  # `has_many :answers` adds the following instance methods
  # to the Question model:

  # answers
  # answers<<(object, ...)
  # answers.delete(object, ...)
  # answers.destroy(object, ...)
  # answers=(objects)
  # answer_ids
  # answer_ids=(ids)
  # answers.clear
  # answers.empty?
  # answers.size
  # answers.find(...)
  # answers.where(...)
  # answers.exists?(...)
  # answers.build(attributes = {}, ...)
  # answers.create(attributes = {})
  # answers.create!(attributes = {})
  # answers.reload

  # Association instance methods can be used as part
  # of an Active Record query chain, for example:
  # q.answers.where("id > ?", 1).order(body: :desc).first

  # on its own but the combination must be unqiue.
