# this is the Question model class
# Rails uses meta programming to add attr_accessor to all associated table's columns
# in this those will be: id, title, body, view_count, created_at, updated_at
class Question < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user

  # So, 1) Ask yourself which end of the many-to-many this is. -> Questions.  Many Questions have many Tags.
  # 2) First define the join table in the middle.
  has_many :taggings, dependent: :destroy
  # You can omit `,source: tag` if your resource name is the plural of the source model name. 
  # You only need to specify it if you named your resource different, e.g. likers vs users.
  has_many :tags, through: :taggings#, source: :tag

  has_many :likers, through: :likes, source: :user

  # When deleting the instance of a model with associated rows (dependents),
  # the foreign key constraint will prevent it from being deleted. We can
  # tell active to first delete the dependents before the deleting the
  # model instance. This is what the `dependent: :destroy` argument does
  # with the `has_many` method.

  # Use `dependent: :nullify` to instead set the foreign key column to `NULL`
  # of the dependent instead of deleting.
  has_many :answers, dependent: :destroy

  # `has_many :answers` adds the following instance methods
  # to the Question model:

  # answers
  # answers<<(object, ...)
  # answers.delete(object, ...)
  # answers.destroy(object, ...)
  # answers=(objects)
  # answer_ids
  # answer_ids=(ids)
  # answers.clear
  # answers.empty?
  # answers.size
  # answers.find(...)
  # answers.where(...)
  # answers.exists?(...)
  # answers.build(attributes = {}, ...)
  # answers.create(attributes = {})
  # answers.create!(attributes = {})
  # answers.reload

  # Association instance methods can be used as part
  # of an Active Record query chain, for example:
  # q.answers.where("id > ?", 1).order(body: :desc).first

  # on its own but the combination must be unqiue.

  # `before_validation` is a lifecycle callback method that allows

  # and calls that method at the appropriate time.

  # This is a virtual column. It does not acutally exist in the table, but it's as if it does.
